Hi Pete I am still getting used to how the files are created/storeed in IntelliJ, and the ones i created first have a package
that came with a template I used, and the ones I worked on in class didn't transfer all the files over to my own computer
so they are in seperate .java files. Sorry it's such a mess I hope you can still read them and see what I've done. I'll be
doing research this weekend on how it all works so this doesn't happen again.
